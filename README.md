# Horiseon Boosts Business

## Client Needs
- Horiseon created a webpage that was missing some key elements for functionality and this was causing some confusion for their clients. They wanted their site to meet accessibility standards in order for it to be optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The source code should follow proper HTML semantics:
    - To fulfill this, improper HTML elements were removed and replaced with correct semantic elements.
- Styling code and positioning should be clear and concise:
    - This was achieved by removing repetitive css code and unnecessary class selectors, replacing them with proper formatting.
- For accessibility purposes, there should be text added to photos in the event that the photo does not render:
    - The HTML code now reflects alt attributes for the images to solve this potential issue.
- Ensure that the headings of each section of the website are chronological:
    - The webpage HTML and CSS code contain elements h1-h4 in sequential order from the top to the bottom of the page.
- Create a clear and concise title for users to understand:
    - A title was created with the text "Horiseon Boosts Business" to specify that Horiseon can help your business improve.
